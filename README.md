## Development Server

1. Run the `ng serve` command for a development server.

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. If you change any of the source files, the application automatically reloads.

## Code Scaffolding

Run the `ng generate component component-name` or `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module` command to generate a new component.

## Builds

1. Run the `ng build` command to build the project. The build artifacts are stored in the `dist/` directory.

1. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run the `ng test` command to execute the unit tests with [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### End-to-End Tests

1. Make sure you are serving the application through `ng serve` before running the tests.

1. Run the `ng e2e` command to execute the end-to-end tests with [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
